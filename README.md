Implementation of D3 visualizations in progress. To continue working on this branch, download latest version of D3js from https://d3js.org/. Also include d3 gem and run "bundle install". D3js is a JavaScript library that allows one to manipulate documents based on data. We have currently implemented a graph using a custom dataset. The goal is to use a php script to pull from the database and convert it into json format. We then use an AJAX request to take the json formatted data and convert it into a graph.
